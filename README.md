## Overview

This is a blog project for people to sign in and write articles about science.

## My Process

A friend of mine  who wrote the articles came up with the idea and texted me if I could do the Html/CSS side.
I was inspired by the (https://medium.com)'s design.
So I divided the page into 3 parts. Header, main and footer.
First I made the header.html and footer.html. Then I applied the CSS into them.
After that I made a template for the main content.
Finally I just implemented the articles that my friend gave me to the template i made.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
